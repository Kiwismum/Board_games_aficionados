            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a community in Puketapu, a town in New Zealand. We run a club called Board games aficionados. As the name implies this club prides itself on keeping tradional board game playing active. With all the online and video game activty today it is no wonder the traditional board game playing is a dying practice. Even these humble games have become fantastic digital equivalents.</p>

            <p>This club meets regulary to play some of these board games. We meet up at each others houses or in some cases we would hold a social event and rent out a conference room. The larger events tend to include some competitions and the results recorded.</p>
